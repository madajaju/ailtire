# ailtire implementation

Manage and interact with implementations in the system, including creating methods, retrieving images, and managing third-party components.

## Synopsis

```shell
ailtire implementation <command> [args]
ailtire implementation filestructure --name <string> --model <string> --package <string>
ailtire implementation image --name <string>
ailtire implementation images --name <string>
ailtire implementation thirdparty --name <string>
```

## Description

The `implementation` command provides tools to work with methods, images, and third-party components.  
Using this command, users can create methods for specific models, retrieve deployment images, and fetch third-party component details.

## Commands

### `filestructure`
- **Usage**:
  ```shell
  ailtire implementation filestructure --name <string> --model <string> --package <string>
  ```
- **Description**:
  Creates a new method in a specified model with the provided package structure.

---

### `image`
- **Usage**:
  ```shell
  ailtire implementation image --name <string>
  ```
- **Description**:
  Retrieves an image from deployments based on the specified name.

---

### `images`
- **Usage**:
  ```shell
  ailtire implementation images --name <string>
  ```
- **Description**:
  Retrieves multiple images from deployments associated with the specified name.

---

### `thirdparty`
- **Usage**:
  ```shell
  ailtire implementation thirdparty --name <string>
  ```
- **Description**:
  Fetches details of third-party components associated with the specified name.

## Examples

### Example 1: Create a method in a model
```shell
ailtire implementation filestructure --name "MyMethod" --model "MyModel" --package "com.example"
```

### Example 2: Retrieve a specific deployment image
```shell
ailtire implementation image --name "ImageName"
```

### Example 3: Retrieve multiple images for a deployment
```shell
ailtire implementation images --name "DeploymentName"
```

### Example 4: Fetch third-party component details
```shell
ailtire implementation thirdparty --name "ComponentName"
```

## Notes

- The `filestructure` subcommand is used for creating new methods within a specified model and package structure.
- `image` and `images` both deal with retrieving deployment-related images but can be applied depending on the retrieval scope.
- `thirdparty` is focused on fetching third-party components associated with the specified name.
- Ensure that the `--name`, `--model`, and `--package` options are provided accurately for the desired command.
