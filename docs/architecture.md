## Logical Layer

The **Logical** layer defines the foundational constructs of the architecture, focusing on the core system elements and
their interactions. At its heart, [Actions](action) define the operations and behaviors that enable interaction with
data models and other logical components. [Models](model) represent the essential data structures and relationships that
form the backbone of the system, ensuring consistency and integrity. [Packages](package) encapsulate related
functionality and domain logic, organizing the system into distinct subsystems that promote modularity and clear
separation of concerns. Together, these elements provide a cohesive framework for the system’s functionality.

## Deployment Layer

The **Deployment** layer is responsible for the configuration and organization of services, ensuring efficient and
secure operation. The [Micro-Segmented Network](deployment#network) establishes a secure communication framework, using
firewalls and access controls to manage interactions between components. [Micro-Services](deployment#microservice) are
self-contained units of functionality that work within the broader system, enabling scalability and independent
development. A [Service Stack](deployment#stack) groups these micro-services and their corresponding networks to support
a specific [Package](package) and its sub-packages. The layer also defines [Interfaces](package#interface) such as CLIs,
REST APIs, and Web UIs to facilitate access and interaction with the deployed services.

## Implementation Layer

The **Implementation** layer focuses on the practical construction and deployment of the
system. [Images](implementation#image) encapsulate micro-service functionality into deployable containers, tailored for
specific [Environments](implementation#environment) like Development, Testing, and Production.
The [Component](directory) directory provides a clear file structure, guiding developers in building, organizing, and
managing the system’s code and resources. This layer bridges the logical design and the operational deployment, ensuring
that the architecture is realized efficiently in various real-world contexts.

## Use Case Model

The **Use Case Model** ensures the system is designed to meet user needs and achieve business goals
effectively. [Actors](actor), which can include users, applications, or packages, interact with the system through
defined [Use Cases](usecase) that describe specific objectives. [Scenarios](scenario) provide detailed sequences of
steps, showing how an actor engages with a use case to accomplish a task. Each step, represented by
a [Step](scenario#step), corresponds to a method call with specified parameters. This layer translates high-level
requirements into actionable system interactions, enabling a user-centered design approach.

## Quality Assurance Layer

The **Quality Assurance** layer focuses on validating the functionality and reliability of the
system. [Test Suites](test) group related [Tests](test) to assess various aspects of the application based on use cases,
scenarios, and specific QA requirements. Individual tests ensure that components meet functional, performance, and
security expectations. This layer provides a structured framework for identifying and addressing issues, ensuring the
system operates as intended and adheres to defined quality standards.

## Process Layer

The **Process** layer organizes the execution of workflows and activities that achieve specific business
objectives. [Activities](activity) are discrete tasks performed in sequence to accomplish defined goals,
while [Workflows](workflow) orchestrate these activities into structured, end-to-end processes. [Workspaces](workspace)
provide the necessary environments, tools, and configurations to support these processes, tailored to the specific needs
of each workflow. This layer ensures efficient, repeatable execution of complex processes, enhancing overall system
productivity.

## Physical Layer
The **Physical** layer provides the essential hardware and infrastructure that underpin the system's deployment and
operation. [Compute](compute) resources, such as physical servers, virtual machines, or cloud-based instances, supply
the processing power necessary for running micro-services, workflows, and other operations. [Storage](storage) solutions
ensure the availability of persistent and temporary data, incorporating databases, file systems, and object storage to
meet various data management needs. The [Network](network) component establishes reliable communication pathways between
system elements, leveraging physical and virtual networking infrastructure to enable seamless data transfer and
connectivity. Finally, [Location](location) determines the physical or virtual placement of these resources, addressing
concerns related to latency, redundancy, fault tolerance, and regulatory compliance through strategies involving data
centers, cloud regions, and edge computing sites. Together, these elements form the robust foundation needed to support
the system’s logical and operational layers.
