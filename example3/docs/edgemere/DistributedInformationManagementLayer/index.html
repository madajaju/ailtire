<h2>Logical Artifacts</h2>
The Data Model for the  Distributed Information Management Layer shows how the different objects and classes of object interact
and their structure.

<h2>Activities and Flows</h2>
The Distributed Information Management Layer subsystem provides the following activities and flows.

<h2>Deployment Architecture</h2>
This subsystem is deployed using micro-services as shown in the diagram below. The 'micro' module is
used to implement the micro-services in the system.
The subsystem also has an CLI, REST and Web Interface exposed through a sailajs application. The sailsjs
application will interface with the micro-services and can monitor and drive work-flows through the mesh of
micro-services.

<h2>Physical Architecture</h2>
The Distributed Information Management Layer subsystem is is physically laid out on a hybrid cloud infrastructure. Each microservice is shown
how they connect to each other. All of the micro-services communicate to each other and the main app through a
REST interface. A CLI, REST or Web interface for the app is how other subsystems or actors interact. Requests are
forwarded to micro-services through the REST interface of each micro-service.

<h2>Micro-Services</h2>
These are the micro-services for the subsystem. The combination of the micro-services help implement
the subsystem's logic.
